# Pomodoro Timer

A simple Pomodoro Timer built with Python's Tkinter module. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This timer application allows you to track your work sessions and breaks with visual indicators.
